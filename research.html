                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>My research focusses on the ballot initiative process in the United States, and how actors across the federal system interact to disrupt the status quo.
                      My current project is looking at initiative funding, comparing funding levels and sources both within issue groups and across states.
                    I have spent time conducting fieldwork in Oregon, interviewing ballot initiative proponents and state politicians surrounding the two most recent marijuana legalisation ballot measures (Measures 80 and 91).</p>
                    <p> My latest project is looking at campaign finance contributions on a comparative scale within US ballot initiative races - what type of groups finance campaigns, how much does each group contribute, and are some forms of campaign contributions more effective than others?</p>
