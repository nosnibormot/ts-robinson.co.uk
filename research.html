                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>My research focusses on the ballot initiative process in the United States, and how actors across the federal system interact to disrupt the status quo.
                      I am very interested in how actors leverage the federal structure for policymaking purposes, and the nature of the relationships between levels of government.
                    <p> My latest project is looking at campaign finance contributions on a comparative scale within US ballot initiative races - what type of groups finance campaigns, how much does each group contribute, and are some forms of campaign contributions more effective than others?</p>
                    <p>Previously, I worked on drug liberalisation policies passed via the initiative process.
                      With funding from the Rothermere American Institute, I was able to conduct fieldwork in Oregon, interviewing ballot initiative proponents and state politicians surrounding the two most recent marijuana legalisation ballot measures (Measures 80 and 91).</p>
