                    <p>I am a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford studying for an MPhil in Politics (Comparative Government).
                      I am also a part-time research assistant for the Centre for Experimental Social Science (CESS) at Nuffield College under Professor Raymond Duch.</p>
                    <p> Prior to the MPhil, I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford and graduated in July 2016. Throughout my time at Oxford, I've been a member of St Anne's College.</p>
                    <p>Outside of University, I am also a keen road cyclist. I regularly take part in sportives, and have a particular passion for hill climbing!
                    My blog tends to be about cycling, training and routes in the Oxfordshire/Buckinghamshire area and the South Downs.
                    My bucket list includes doing a cycle tour along the Silk Road and hiking (at least part of) the Pacific Crest Trail.</p>
