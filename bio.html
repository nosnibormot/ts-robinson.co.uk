                    <p>I am a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford studying for an MPhil in Politics (Comparative Government).
                    I also studied at Oxford as an undergraduate, and read for a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics.</p>
                    <p>During my time at university as an undergrad, I worked on the student newspaper <i>Cherwell</i> as Comment Editor and subsequently on the senior editorial team (Trinity 2015).</p>
                    <p>Outside of University, I am a keen road cyclist. I regularly take part in sportives, and have a particular passion for hill climbing!
                    My blog tends to be about cycling and routes in the Oxfordshire/Buckinghamshire area and the South Downs.</p>
