                    <p>I am a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford studying for an MPhil in Politics (Comparative Government).
                    I also have a BA from Oxford, having studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics as an undergraduate.</p>
                    <p>Outside of University, I am a keen road cyclist. I regularly take part in sportives, and have a particular penchant for hill climbing!
                    My blog is typically about cycling-related matters and routes in/around Oxford or the South Downs.</p>
